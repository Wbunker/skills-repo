Review this coding session and provide feedback on the user's prompting style. The goal is to help the user improve how they communicate with the assistant so they get better results faster.

Analyze the conversation and provide:

## 1. Prompts That Worked Well
- What did the user say that was effective?
- Why did it work?

## 2. Prompts That Could Have Been Better
For each problematic prompt:
- **What the user said:** [quote the user's actual prompt]
- **The issue:** [why it was unclear, ambiguous, or led to wrong results]
- **What the user should have said:** [rewritten version that would have gotten the result they wanted faster]
- **Why it's better:** [brief explanation]

## 3. Patterns the User Should Fix
- Is the user being too vague in certain areas?
- Is the user giving too much or too little context?
- Is the user using the wrong terminology for this codebase?
- Is the user asking for multiple things when they should break them up (or vice versa)?

## 4. Missing Context the User Should Have Provided
- What information did the assistant have to ask for or guess at?
- What should the user include upfront next time?

## 5. Quick Reference for Next Session
Provide 3-5 concrete rules the user should follow when prompting the assistant on this codebase, based on the mistakes made in this session.

Be direct and specific. Provide actionable feedback, not general advice.
