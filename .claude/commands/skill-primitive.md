Use your skill-builder skill to build a $0 expert skill. I read $1 by $2. Use its chapter structure to organize. Make the skill use progressive disclosure so that each type of information is only loaded if we are doing that particular skill. Put the skill in the project directory where we are working both as .skill file and an unpacked directory so I can read.
